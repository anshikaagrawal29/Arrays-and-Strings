// Method 1: 

   ]1. Sort and then loop until we see arr[i] + 1 = number 
   
   Method 2:
   
   1. FInd smallest element in array.
   2. Put all elements of array in hashset
   num = smallest element found in point 1
   3. while(true)
   {
        if(h.Contains(num)
        {
          n++;
        }
        else
        flag = false;
   }
   
   4. answer would be from smallest to n-1 numbers are longest subsequence.
