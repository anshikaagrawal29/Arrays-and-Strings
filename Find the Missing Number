Way 1: 
 1. Find the largest  number from the array
 2. No do sum from 0 to that number.
 3. Do sum of all elements of array
 4. No subtract both and you will get answer
 
 Complexity : O(n)
 
 Way 2: 
 
1. Sort the array and iterate and check : Complexity : O(nlogn)

Way 3: 

1. Create the BST
2. Do inorder traversal and with that find the element : O(n)
